#
# Data in computer programs is represented by different types.
# String (first example) is basically a text
# Integer (second example) is a number
# Boolean (third and fourth examples) can take one of two values: true or false.
#
# This program shows usage of variables. Variables are kind of a storage for
# information. In this case the variable "name" stores a value "Grzegorz" (which
# is of string type). Variables can later change values they store.
#


name = "Grzegorz"
age = 42
is_smoker = false
is_lazy = true

puts "#{name} is #{age} years old. Is a smoker? #{is_smoker}. Is lazy? #{is_lazy}"
