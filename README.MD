# TechLadies Pre-Bootcamp Workshop 1 - Get Started

Hi! In this repository you will find exercises that we did at the first workshop. Before starting this workshop, you should have followed the installation guide here: [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zskxxJw9lQHMYLwp-3RNE-r0wRWkOmossib258bgoT4/edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zskxxJw9lQHMYLwp-3RNE-r0wRWkOmossib258bgoT4/edit)

You can also find the workshop recording at this link: [https://engineers.sg/video/techladies-pre-bootcamp-workshop-1-get-started--954](https://engineers.sg/video/techladies-pre-bootcamp-workshop-1-get-started--954)

The workshop is broken down into two parts. The first part, introduction to Ruby, explains basic concepts of the language. You should start from this part.

The 2nd part is more difficult. During the workshop We wrote a "Guess the Number" game during the workshop, and you can see all the codes we have done step-by-step.

This repository also contains a bit more than we covered in the workshop: I've updated some code to make it more clear, I've added comments that will help you understand the code, and finally the game has a few more features that we didn't manage to add during workshop.

Enjoy!
