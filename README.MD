# TechLadies pre-bootcamp Workshop 1

Hi! In this repository you will find exercises that we did at the first workshop.
The first part, introduction to Ruby, explains basic concepts of the language. You should start from this part.

The 2nd part is more difficult. During the workshop we wrote a "Guess the number" game and this directory contains all the steps we did, one by one.

Repository contains a bit more than we covered in the workshop: I updated some code to make it more clear, I added comments that will help you understand the code, and finally the game has a few more features that we didn't manage to add during workshop.

Enjoy!
